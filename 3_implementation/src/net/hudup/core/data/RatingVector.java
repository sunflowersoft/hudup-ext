 * This class represents a vector (an array) of ratings. As a convention, its is called rating vector.
 * Recall that rating represented by {@link Rating} class contains following important information relevant to the event a user rates on an item
 * <ol>
 * <li>Rating value represented by {@link Rating#value} is a double number that a user rates on an item.</li>
 * <li>The date that a user rates on an item, represented by {@link Rating#ratedDate}. Of course it contains year, month, day, hour, minute, second, etc.</li>
 * <li>A list of contexts that a user rates on an item, represented by {@link Rating#contexts}. Context is additional information related to user's rating, for example, place that user makes a rating,
 * companion indicating the persons with whom user makes a rating such as alone, friends, girlfriend/boyfriend, family, co-workers. </li>
 * </ol>
 * As a definition, a rating is called {@code rated} (user rated an item) if its rating value is not {@link Constants#UNUSED}; otherwise such rating is called {@code unrated}.
 * Note that rating does not specify user identification (user ID) and item identification (item ID). This aspect is very important, which derives two kinds of rating vector such as user rating vector and item rating vector.
 * If this class is user rating vector, it contains all ratings of the same user on many items and so the internal variable {@link #id} is user identification (user ID).
 * If this class is item rating vector, it contains all ratings of many users on the same item and so the internal variable {@link #id} is item identification (item ID).
 * As a convention, the internal variable {@link #id} is known as ID of rating vector.
