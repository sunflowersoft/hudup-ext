/**
 * This class represents a rating that a user gives on an item. As a convention this class is called {@code rating}.
 * In current implementation, a rating includes three important parts as follows:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Rating value represented by {@link #value} is a double number that a user rates on an item.</li>
 * <li>The date that a user rates on an item, represented by {@link #ratedDate}. Of course it contains year, month, day, hour, minute, second, etc.</li>
 * <li>A list of contexts that a user rates on an item, represented by {@link #contexts}. Context is additional information related to user's rating, for example, place that user makes a rating,
 * companion indicating the persons with whom user makes a rating such as alone, friends, girlfriend/boyfriend, family, co-workers. </li>
 * </ol>
 * As a definition, a rating is called {@code rated} (user rated an item) if its rating value is not {@link Constants#UNUSED}; otherwise such rating is called {@code unrated}.
 * Note that rating does not specify user identification (user ID) and item identification (item ID).
 * A set of rating that the same user gives on many item makes a so-called rating vector represented by {@link RatingVector}.
