 * Any class that implements this interface is called {@code provider associator} which assists the provider specified by interface {@code Provider} to performs read-write operations.
 * Exactly, provider associator provides low-level data operators such as processing (creating and removing) unit and processing profile.
 * Note, the {@code unit} represents a CSV file, database table, Excel sheet, etc. Unit is used to store object such as user profile, item profile, rating matrix, etc.
 * {@code Profile} is one of important data structures, like record of table in database, has a list of values. Each value belongs to a particular attribute. Profile uses attributes to specify its data types.
 * In current implementation of Hudup framework, provider associator is created by the factory class.
 * Such factory will create provider associator according to specific configuration, for example, the associator for flat archive system having no structure like file system is different from the associator for database system.
 * For instance, the provider associator for flat archive system uses {@code UriAdapter} for low-level data operators.
 * Provider associator for database system uses {@code java.sql.Connection} for low-level data operators.
 * The work flow relevant to provider associator is that {@code Provider} uses {@code ProviderAssoc} which in turn uses adapters ({@code UriAdapter}, {@code java.sql.Connection}).
