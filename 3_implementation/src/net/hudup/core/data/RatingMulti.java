/**
 * This class is firstly similar to {@link Rating} contains ratings of one user giving on many items or ratings of one item receiving from many users.
 * However, it stores the history of ratings that users have given on items. Every time a user rates on an item, such rating value is added into the history and so there is no overridden rating copying as {@link RatingVector} does.
 * Such history is referred by its new variable {@link #history}.
 * Programmers can keep track the long process that users have rated on items.
 * In current implementation, this class is still simple but it is very potential for innovative learning algorithms that takes advantages of the history of ratings for recommendation.
