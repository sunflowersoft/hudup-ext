 * This interface establishes the rule that all classes which implements {@link AutoCloseable} has a mechanism of auto-closing.

 * The common implementation of {@link #close()} method is to release resources occupied by auto-closable object.
 * The {@code finalize()} method of auto-closable class should call {@link #close()} method.
 * Concretely, if programmer forgets closing auto-closable object to release resources after using such object,
 * the {@link #close()} is automatically called by the {@code finalize()} to close release resources before the Java garbage collector destroys such object.
