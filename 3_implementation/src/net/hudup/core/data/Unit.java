/**
 * Objects in framework such as {@code profile}, {@code item profile}, {@code user profile}, {@code rating matrix}, {@code interchanged attribute map} are stored in archives (files) of entire framework.
 * Each archive (file) is called {@code unit} representing a CSV file, database table, Excel sheet, etc.
 * This class just represents the name of unit but there are special classes processing on unit and so this class is identical to unit.
 * <br>
 * Unit class has variable {@link #name} representing its name and variable {@link #extra} indicating whether or not this unit is essential one. 
 * If {@code extra=true}, this unit is extra (auxiliary) unit and so it is not essential unit.
 * If {@code extra=false}, this unit is essential (important, main) unit such as rating matrix.
 * The default value of this variable is {@code extra=false}, which means that a new unit is important one by default.
 * When showing, the name of essential unit ({@code extra=false}) is shown within signs &quot;&lt;&quot; and &quot;&gt;&quot;,
 * for example, the name of rating unit is shown &quot;&lt;rating&gt;&quot;.
