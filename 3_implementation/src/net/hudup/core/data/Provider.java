/**
 * {@code Dataset} only provides read-only operations via &quot;get&quot; and &quot;fetch&quot; methods.
 * Thus, {@code Provider} interface and its implementations support storage service in service layer to update and modify database via writing operations.
 * {@code Provider} interacts directly with database, which is created in data layer.
 * For example, {@link #updateRating(RatingVector)} method saves rating values that user makes on items to database.
 * {@code Provider} also provides read-only accesses to database. So, in many situations, {@code Scanner} uses {@code Provider} to retrieve information from database because {@code Scanner} does not store information in memory.
 * <br>
 * Moreover, {@code Provider} manipulates context and context template via context template schema manager (CTS manager) represented by {@link CTSManager}.
 * {@code Provider}  provides most of read-write data operations (get, insert, update, delete).
 * Provider uses provider associator represented by {@link ProviderAssoc} for low-level data operators.
 * Every provider own a configuration represented by {@link DataConfig} for initialization (setting up).
 * <br>
 * In general, provider allows programmers to access all data objects stored in archives (files) of entire framework. These data objects constitute framework database including user profile, item profile, rating matrix, context template, context, etc.
 * Each archives (file) is called {@code unit} representing a CSV file, database table, Excel sheet, etc.
 * Such database has the schema. Please distinguish such framework database schema from context template schema because the framework schema contains template schema.
