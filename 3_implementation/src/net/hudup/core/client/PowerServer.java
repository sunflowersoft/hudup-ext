/**
 * {@link PowerServer} is a powerful {@link Server} with advanced functions such as supporting balancing and retrieving service.
 * For example, there is a counter inside {@link ActiveMeasure}.
 * Note that {@link ActiveMeasure} interface specifies how to measure the active degree of {@link PowerServer}.
 * Each time {@link PowerServer} receives a user request, the counter is increased by 1.
 * After {@link PowerServer} finishes serving such user request, the counter is decreased by 1.
 * If there are many {@link PowerServer} (s) deployed on different sites, balancer uses {@link ActiveMeasure} to determine which {@link PowerServer} is least busy in order to dispatch user request to such {@link PowerServer} whose active counter is smallest.
 * <br>
 * Note, the sub-architecture of recommendation server (recommender) is inspired from the architecture of Oracle database management system (Oracle DBMS);
 * especially concepts of listener and share memory layer are borrowed from concepts &quot;Listener&quot; and &quot;System Global Area&quot; of Oracle DBMS, respectively,
