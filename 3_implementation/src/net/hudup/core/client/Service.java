/**
 * Service interface specifies methods to serve user requests. These methods focus on providing recommendation, inserting, updating and getting information such as user ratings, user profiles, and item profiles stored in database.
 * Service extends {@link Remote}, which means that service supports RMI (abbreviation of Java Remote Method Invocation) for remote interaction in client-server architecture. The tutorial of RMI is available at <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/rmi">https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/rmi</a>.
 * In the architecture of Hudup server, the service layer is mainly composed of recommendation service and storage service.
 * Recommendation service is responsible to use concrete recommendation algorithms ({@code Recommender}) to produce a list of recommended items according to user request.
 * Storage service allows users to retrieve and update information from/to database. Storage service also creates {@link Snapshot} and {@code Scanner} which are image of dataset at certain time point.
 * However, in the current implementation, these two services are merged into this {@code service} interface whose methods are of both recommendation service and storage service.
 * <br>
 * Programmers are responsible for implementing this service.
