/**
 * {@code Response} class represents result of Hudup services such as recommendation task, updating database, information retrieval.
 * Response has many public variables for storing different results. Each response corresponds with a particular request ({@code Request}) class.
 * {@code Response} uses JSON format as exchangeable means. Note, JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a human-read format used for interchange between many protocols, available at <a href="http://www.json.org/">http://www.json.org</a>.
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * In case of recommendation request, response is the list of recommended items returned from service layer.
 * Exactly, response wraps the returned {@link RatingVector} of methods {@code Recommender.estimate(...)} and {@code Recommender.recommend(...)}.
 * The public variable {@link #vRating} refers to such rating vector.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * For update request, response is the output variable indicating whether or not update request is successful.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * For retrieval request, response is the piece of information stored in {@code Dataset} or {@code KBase}. If information is stored in {@code Dataset}, response often wraps a returned {@code Snapshot}.
 * Note, {@code dataset} includes essentially rating matrix, user profiles, item profiles and context information.
 * Snapshot is defined as an image of piece of dataset and knowledge base ({@code KBase}) at certain time point.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * Both request (represented by {@code Request} class) and response (represented by {@code Response} class) extend directly protocol parameter specified by abstract class {@link ProtocolParam} and so they have a tight interaction.
