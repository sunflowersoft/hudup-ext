/**
 * Note, {@code Request} class represents user request. {@code Request} uses JSON format as exchangeable means in client-server network. Note, JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a human-read format used for interchange between many protocols, available at <a href="http://www.json.org/">http://www.json.org</a>.
 * User request includes recommendation request, retrieval request, update request.
 * Each request has a so-called {@code action} which is a short description (short string) of such request. Action can be considered as the purpose of request.
 * For example, the request that user requires a list of recommended items has action &quot;recommend_user&quot;.
 * <br>
 * Request also contains many public variables for specifying its purpose (its result). For example, the recommendation request uses its public variable {@link #recommend_param} to store parameter of recommendation.
 * Such information contains user profile, ratings of such user on many items, list of contexts (place, time, accompany) relevant to user ratings.
 * <br>
 * Both request (represented by {@code Request} class) and response (represented by {@code Response} class) extend directly protocol parameter specified by abstract class {@link ProtocolParam} and so they have a tight interaction.
 * There are two types of request as follows:
 * <br>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * Recommendation request is that user prefers to get favorite items. Exactly, this request wraps {@link RecommendParam} which is the first input parameter of methods {@code Recommender.estimate(...)} and {@code Recommender.recommend(...)}.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Retrieval or update request is that user wants to retrieve or update her/his ratings and profiles.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
