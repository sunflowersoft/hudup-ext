/**
 * {@code Protocol} interface specifies methods to create request represented by {@link Request} of Hudup client-server network in many possible cases.
 * Note, {@code Request} class represents user request. {@code Request} uses JSON format as exchangeable means in client-server network. Note, JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a human-read format used for interchange between many protocols, available at <a href="http://www.json.org/">http://www.json.org</a>.
 * User request includes recommendation request, retrieval request, update request.
 * Each request has a so-called {@code action} which is a short description (short string) of such request. Action can be considered as the purpose of request.
 * For example, the request that user requires a list of recommended items has action &quot;recommend_user&quot;.
 * <br>
 * {@code Protocol} establishes an interaction protocol of Hudup client-server network, which is named &quot;<b>hdp</b>&quot;.
 * Each method of protocol creates a particular request, for example, the method {@link #createRecommendRequest(RecommendParam, int)} will create a request that user requires a list of recommended items.
 * {@code Protocol} also defines actions of requests as constants.
