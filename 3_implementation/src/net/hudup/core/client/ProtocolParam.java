 * This abstract class represents a parameter for Hudup protocol. As a convention, it is called {@code protocol parameter}.
 * Two directed implementations of this {@code protocol parameter} are request represented by {@code Request} class and response represented by {@code Response} class.
 * Request includes recommendation request, retrieval request, update request.
 * Response stores result of Hudup services corresponding a particular request.
 * Both request and response extend directly this protocol parameter so they have a tight interaction.
 * <br>
 * Note, the Hudup protocol represented by {@code Protocol} interface establishes an interaction protocol of Hudup client-server network, which is named &quot;<b>hdp</b>&quot;.
 * Methods of {@code Protocol} uses request and response as returned values.
