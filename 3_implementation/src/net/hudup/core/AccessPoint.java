 * This class is called {@code access point} which is used to start modules of Hudup framework.
 * There are 5 applications of Hudup framework such as {@code Evaluator}, {@code Server}, {@code Listener}, {@code Balancer}, {@code Toolkit}.
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code Evaluator} makes evaluation on recommendation algorithms.</li>
 * <li>{@code Server} runs as a recommendation server that serves incoming user request for producing a list of recommended items or allowing users to access database.</li>
 * <li>{@code Listener} is responsible for receiving requests from users and dispatching such request to {@code Server}.
 * <li>{@code Balancer} is a special {@code Listener} that supports balancing.</li>
 * <li>{@code Toolkit} is a utility application that assists users to set up and modify Hudup database.</li>
 * </ul>
 * These applications must implement this interface. In fact, this interface plays the role of access point of any application.
