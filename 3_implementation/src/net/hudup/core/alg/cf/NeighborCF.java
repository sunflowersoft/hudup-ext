/**
 * This class sets up the neighbor collaborative filtering (Neighbor CF) algorithm. It is memory-based CF because it extends directly {@link MemoryBasedCF} class.
 * Neighbor CF algorithm finds out the nearest neighbor of active user (or active item).
 * Later on, Neighbor CF algorithm recommends items that the nearest neighbor likes (rates with high value) to the active user, with assumption that the nearest neighbor and the active user (active item) share the same interests.
 * <br>
 * The most important feature of any Neighbor CF algorithm is how to calculate the similarity between two rating vectors or between two profiles so as to find out the nearest neighbor.
 * The nearest neighbor is the one who has highest similar measure with the active user (active item).
 * This class provides the method {@link #similar(RatingVector, RatingVector, Profile, Profile)} to calculate the similarity measure between two pairs.
 * The first pair includes the first rating vector and the first profile.
 * The second pair includes the second rating vector and the second profile.
 * If you only want to calculate the similarity between two rating vectors, two in put profiles are set to be null.
 * If you only want to calculate the similarity between two profiles, two in put rating vectors are set to be null.
 * In current implementation, only three similarity measures are supported such as Pearson, cosine, and hybrid.
 * Hybrid measure means that profile is merged into rating vector as a unified vector for calculating Pearson measure or cosine measure.
