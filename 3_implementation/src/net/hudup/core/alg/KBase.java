/**
 * Data in Hudup framework is organized into two following formats:
 * <br>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * Low-level format is structured as rating matrix whose each row consists of user ratings on items, often called raw data.
 * Another low-level format is dataset represented by {@link Dataset} which consists of rating matrix and other information such as user profile, item profile and contextual information.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * High-level format contains fine-grained information and knowledge extracted from raw data and dataset, for example, user interests and user purchasing pattern; besides, it may have internal inference mechanism which allows us to deduce new knowledge.
 * High-level format structure is called {@code knowledge base} or {@code KBase} in short.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * Model-based recommender represented by {@code ModelBasedRecommender} class applies {@code KBase} into performing recommendation task.
 * In other words, {@code KBase} provides both necessary information and inference mechanism to model-based recommender.
 * Ability of inference is the unique feature of {@code KBase}.
 * <br>
 * Every model-based recommender owns distinguished {@code KBase}.
 * For example, if model-based recommender uses frequent purchase pattern to make recommendation, its {@code KBase} contains such pattern.
 * <br>
 * In general, {@code KBase} is a significant aspect of Hudup framework. Followings are essential methods of {code KBase}:
 * <br>
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * Method {@link #setConfig(DataConfig)} is responsible for setting configurations for {code KBase}.
 * These configurations are used by other methods. The typical configuration is uniform resource identifier (URI) indicating where to store {@code KBase},
 * which is used by methods {@link #load()} and {@link #save()}.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Methods {@link #load()} and {@link #save()} are used to read/write {@code KBase} from/to storage system, respectively. Storage system can be files, database, etc.
 * The methods {@link #load()} and {@link #save()} indicate that {@code KBase} can be loaded from and saved to storage system. They do not specify how to load and store {@code KBase}.
 * In other words, they are rules with which the infrastructure must comply.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Method {@link #learn(Dataset, Alg)} is responsible for creating {@code KBase} from {@code Dataset} which is the first input parameter.
 * Because every model-based recommender owns distinguished {@code KBase}, the second parameter is such algorithm.
 * The association between model-based recommender and {@code KBase} is tight.
 * The method {@link #learn(Dataset, Alg)} tells us that {@code KBase} can be learned by any approaches: machine learning, data mining, artificial intelligence, statistics, etc.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Methods {@link #clear()} and {@link #isEmpty()} are responsible for cleaning out {@code KBase} and checking whether {@code KBase} is empty or not, respectively.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * Methods of model-based recommender always using {@code KBase} are {@code ModelBasedRecommender.setup()}, {@code ModelBasedRecommender.createKB()}, {@code ModelBasedRecommender.estimate(...)} and {@code ModelBasedRecommender.recommend(...)}.
 * Especially, it is mandatory that {@code setup()} method of model-based recommender calls method {@code KBase.learn(...)} or {@code KBase.load()}.
 * Conversely, the association between memory-based recommender represented by {@code MemoryBasedRecommender} class and dataset indicates that all memory-based algorithms use dataset for recommendation task.<br>
 * <br>
 * {@code KBase} does not support remote call because of three reasons: 1. Security. 2. {@code KBase} is always owned by model-based algorithm and so making a remote model-based algorithm is to create indirectly a remote {@code KBase}.
 * 3. {@code KBase} is too flexible to establish a remote interface (it does not have specific methods).
