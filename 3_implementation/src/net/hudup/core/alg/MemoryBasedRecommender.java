 * As a convention, this class is called memory-based recommender.
 * This memory-based recommender makes recommendation tasks directly on dataset represented by {@code Dataset} class.
 * It often stores rating matrix in memory. Recommendation tasks are executed in memory.
 * Memory-based recommender is often simpler than model-based recommender.
