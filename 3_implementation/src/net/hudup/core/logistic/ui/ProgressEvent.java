/**
 * For example, there is an application {@code A} whose process is to copy file.
 * In the progress of copying, user needs to see the number of transferred bytes.
 * So programmer must implement the interface {@code ProgressListener} as class {@code B} by defining the method {@code ProgressListener.receiveProgress(ProgressEvent)} for showing the number of transferred bytes.
 * Class {@code B} is called a progress listener.
 * Moreover the application {@code A} needs to register the progression listener (class {@code B}).
 * In the method {@code ProgressListener.receiveProgress(ProgressEvent)}, application {@code A} passes necessary information to the progress listener {@code B}.
 * Such information is modeled as this class, called {@code progress event} including two main variables:
 * <ul>
 * <li>The variable {@link #progressTotal} indicates the total amount of works which will be finished, for example, the total number of bytes which will be transferred.</li>
 * <li>The variables {@link #progressStep} indicates the current amount of works which were done, for example, the current number of bytes which were transferred.</li>
 * </ul>
