#Define here custom propertes which replace system properties.

#Demo admin password, remove the "admin" property in real-time application. Instead accounts are stored in account unit of database.
#This administration account is also used to start and stop server and listener from remote control when being impossible to retrieve accounts stored in database.
#admin=admin

#If flag is true, the framework supports compressed file (zip, jar) as storage.
#Currently, Hudup used TrueZip (https://christian-schlichtherle.bitbucket.io/truezip) developed by Christian Schlichtherle to process compressed files.
#When this flag is false, TrueZip is not used. It is more stable if setting this flag to be false. 
#compressed_file_support=false
compressed_file_support=true

#Setting debug mode. If this flag is true, Hudup framework runs in debug mode in which thrown exceptions are printed traced, for example.
#Otherwise, thrown exceptions are not traced and so only error meassages are printed.
#It is faster if setting this flag to be false.
#debug=false
debug=true

#If this flag is true, tested algorithms will be duplicated when evaluator is reproduced.
#evaluator_duplicate_algorithm=false

#Global address is often static internet address or WAN address. When deploying Hudup on WAN or internet, global address must be set.
#global_address=hudup.locnguyen.net

#I18n meassages bundle: en_US, vi_VN, zh_CN, ar_YE
#language=en
#country=US

#Setting pull mode advice. If this property is true, connection to server is advised to be in pull mode to prevent server from unexpected deadlock.
#It is good for local connection if setting this flag to be true.
pull_mode_advice=true
#pull_mode_advice=false

#If flag is true, server has UI. Otherwise, server has no UI, in this case, server is automatically set up at the first time running.
#server_ui=true

#Try to use random port if the default port was in used. Value here is true, which means that ports are flexible.
#It is better if setting this flag to be false.
try_random_port=false
#try_random_port=true

#If flag is true, the server will watch something, concretely, the working library directory working/lib.
#If it is set to be false in case of saving resources.
watcher_enabled=true
#watcher_enabled=false
