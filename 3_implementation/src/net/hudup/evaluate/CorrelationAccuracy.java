/**
 * Currently, two default metrics inherited from {@link DefaultMetric} class are {@link TimeMetric} class and {@link Accuracy} class.
 * {@link TimeMetric} measures the speed of algorithm and so it is the time in seconds that methods {@link Recommender#estimate(net.hudup.core.alg.RecommendParam, Set)} and {@link net.hudup.core.alg.Recommender#recommend(net.hudup.core.alg.RecommendParam, int)} execute over {@link Dataset}.
 * {@link Accuracy} reflects goodness and efficiency of recommendation algorithms. There are three types of accuracy.
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 * Predictive accuracy, represented by {@link PredictiveAccuracy} class, measures how close predicted ratings returned from methods {@link Recommender#estimate(net.hudup.core.alg.RecommendParam, Set)} and {@link net.hudup.core.alg.Recommender#recommend(net.hudup.core.alg.RecommendParam, int)} are to the true user ratings.
 * {@link PredictiveAccuracy} class derives directly from {@link Accuracy} class. {@code MAE}, {@code MSE}, {@code RMSE} are typical predictive accuracy metrics.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Classification accuracy, represented by {@link ClassificationAccuracy} class, measures the frequency that methods {@link Recommender#estimate(net.hudup.core.alg.RecommendParam, Set)} and {@link net.hudup.core.alg.Recommender#recommend(net.hudup.core.alg.RecommendParam, int)} make correct or incorrect recommendation.
 * {@link ClassificationAccuracy} class derives directly from {@link Accuracy} class. {@code Precision} and {@code Recall} are typical classification accuracy metrics.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Correlation accuracy, represented by {@link CorrelationAccuracy} class, measures the ability that method {@link net.hudup.core.alg.Recommender#recommend(net.hudup.core.alg.RecommendParam, int)} makes the ordering of recommended items which is similar to the ordering of user&#39;s favorite items.
 * {@link CorrelationAccuracy} class derives directly from {@link Accuracy} class. {@code NDPM}, {@code Spearman}, {@code Pearson} are typical correlation accuracy metrics.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
