#Define here custom propertes which replace system properties.

#Demo admin password, remove the "admin" property in real-time application. Instead accounts are stored in account unit of database.
#This administration account is also used to start and stop server and listener from remote control when being impossible to retrieve accounts stored in database.
#admin=admin

#This mode is calling explicitly finalize method, which is true if the finalize method of an object is called explicitly when the object is discarded.
#call_finalize=true
call_finalize=false

#This is flag to indicate whether Hudup sever calls internal tasks periodly. It is set to be true by default. If it is false, internal tasks are not called, which can cause some implicit and unexpected problems but the server will be run faster.
#call_server_tasks=true
call_server_tasks=false

#Setting debug mode. If this flag is true, Hudup framework runs in debug mode in which thrown exceptions are printed traced, for example.
#Otherwise, thrown exceptions are not traced and so only error meassages are printed.
#It is faster if setting this flag to be false.
#debug=false
debug=true

#If this flag is true, tested algorithms will be duplicated when evaluator is reproduced.
#evaluator_duplicate_algorithm=true

#Global address is often static internet address or WAN address. When deploying Hudup on WAN or internet, global address must be set.
#global_address=hudup.locnguyen.net

#I18n meassages bundle: en_US, vi_VN, zh_CN, ar_YE
#language=en
#country=US

#Setting pull mode advice. If this property is true, connection to server is advised to be in pull mode to prevent server from unexpected deadlock.
#It is good for remote connection if setting this flag to be true.
pull_mode_advice=true
#pull_mode_advice=false

#If flag is true, server has UI. Otherwise, server has no UI, in this case, server is automatically set up at the first time running.
#server_ui=true

#Try to use random port if the default port was in used. Value here is true, which means that ports are flexible.
#It is better if setting this flag to be false.
try_random_port=false
#try_random_port=true

#If flag is true, the server will watch something, concretely, the working library directory working/lib.
#If it is set to be false in case of saving resources.
watcher_enabled=true
