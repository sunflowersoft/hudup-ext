#Define here custom propertes which replace system properties.

#Demo admin password, remove the "admin" property in real-time application. Instead accounts are stored in account unit of database.
#This administration account is also used to start and stop server and listener from remote control when being imposible to retrieve accounts stored in database.

#If flag is true, the framework supports compressed file (zip, jar) as storage.
#Currently, Hudup used TrueZip (https://christian-schlichtherle.bitbucket.io/truezip) developed by Christian Schlichtherle to process compressed files.
#When this flag is false, TrueZip is not used.
#compressed_file_support=true

#Setting debug mode. If this flag is true, Hudup framework runs in debug mode in which thrown exceptions are printed traced, for example.
#Otherwise, only error meassages are printed in console.
#debug=false

#Global address is often static internet address or WAN address. When deploying Hudup on WAN or internet, global address must be set.
#global_address=hudup.locnguyen.net

#I18n meassages bundle: en_US, vi_VN, zh_CN, ar_YE

#Setting pull mode requirement. If this property is true, connection to server must be in pull mode to prevent server from unexpected deadlock.
#require_pull_mode=false

#If flag is true, server is responsible for purging disconnected listeners. Otherwise, each evaluator or service is responsible for purging disconnected listeners.
#server_purge_listeners=true
